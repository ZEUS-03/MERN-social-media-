# MERN Social Media Application

Welcome to My full stack social media application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This application provides a platform for users to connect, share, and interact with each other through posts and likes.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out securely.
- Profile Management: Users can customize their profiles with profile pictures, cover photos, and bios.
- Post Creation: Users can create and share posts containing text, images, or videos.
- Commenting and Likes: Users can engage with posts by adding comments and liking them.
- Follow and Unfollow: Users can follow and unfollow other users to see their posts in their news feed.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data, posts, comments, and likes.
- Express.js: Backend framework for handling API requests, routing, and middleware.
- React: Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- Axios: HTTP client for making API requests from the frontend.
